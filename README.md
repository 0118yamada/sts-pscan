pscan_samples/
	pscan files created at GSI.
pscan/
	pscan files created at KEK.

COMMENTS:
	execute() in execute.C will execute the process.
	if inputfilename.root exists, just open the root file. Do not invoke the procedure.
	filename should be without ".txt" as it will be added later in the class.
